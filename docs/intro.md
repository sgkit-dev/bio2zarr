# bio2zarr

`bio2zarr` efficiently converts common bioinformatics formats to
[Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) format.

## Tools

- {ref}`sec-vcf2zarr` converts VCF data to
  [VCF Zarr](https://github.com/sgkit-dev/vcf-zarr-spec/) format.

- {ref}`sec-plink2zarr` converts PLINK 1.0 data to
  [VCF Zarr](https://github.com/sgkit-dev/vcf-zarr-spec/) format.

- {ref}`sec-vcfpartition` is a utility to split an input
  VCF into a given number of partitions. This is useful for
  parallel processing of VCF data.

## Development status

`bio2zarr` is in development, contributions, feedback and issues are welcome
at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sgkit-dev/bio2zarr).

If you would like to see
support for other formats such as BGEN (or an interested in helping with implementing),
please open an [issue on Github](https://github.com/sgkit-dev/bio2zarr/issues)
to discuss!


The package is currently focused on command line interfaces, but a
Python API is also planned.

:::{warning}
Although it is possible to import the bio2zarr Python package
the APIs are purely internal for the moment and will change
in arbitrary ways. Please don't use them (or open issues about
them on GitHub).
